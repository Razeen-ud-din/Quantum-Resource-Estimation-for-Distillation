# Quantum-Resource-Estimation-for-Distillation

This reporsitory is for the quantum resource estimation (QRE) for entanglement and nonlocality distillation.

## Introduction 
Welcome to the implementation of for the quantum resource estimation (QRE) for entanglement and nonlocality distillation!
This project is the implementations of the research papers [Concentrating entanglement by local actions: Beyond mean values](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.63.022301) by Hoi-Kwong Lo and 
Sandu Popescu and [Better Bell-inequality violation by collective measurements](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.73.052116)

## Installation

In order to work with the jupyter notebooks of this project, you need a number of packages. The first cell of each notebook is about the installation of different packages and modules therein. Running these cells of each section ensure that you are all setup with the environment. The only prerequisite is that you have `python` installed and any IDE that runs `.ipynb` notebook file i.e Visual studio code or jupyter notebook.

## Implementation

The implementation of the above defined papers and the results of implemetation is in `Qsharp`.
